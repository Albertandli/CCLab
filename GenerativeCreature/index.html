                <p>Mirareformes — the Watchers.
                    A family of dreamcore entities that do not act, but observe with unbearable precision.
                    They are the ones behind the mirror, inside flashbacks, between the lines of old diaries.

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>The third-person self —
                    That strange, soft camera angle you slip into when you recall childhood.
                    It lives in the version of you you observe rather than inhabit.
                    That time you remembered your 10-year-old self sitting alone at lunch — that is where it lives.

                    It does not belong to the past.
                    It belongs to the act of remembering.
                </p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>A block-shaped body with matching block-shaped hair that shifts color depending on how many memories
                    it's been fed. It glows faintly with light blue contours. Its eyes are white when calm, but turn red
                    when disturbed or angry.
                </p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It only loves to see memories, like fireflies — never to feel them. Observation is its only joy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a memory disappears, no matter the cause, it believes you took it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It often appears as a distant version of you, from an old memory.
                    </li>

                It is not cruel — only incapable of understanding human intimacy.
                To it, distance is connection. Closeness is theft.

                It may blink into view during lucid dreams, déjà vu, or heavy nostalgia.
                If you feel you're being watched during a memory — you are.

                It does not forget.
                It stores nothing, yet it forgets nothing, because it never holds.


                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Do not approach.
                The closer you get, the more the memory collapses.

                Never give it a memory.
                Let memories drift where it can see them. That is mercy.

                Do not speak to it. It understands gaze, not voice.

                You may watch it back.
                In quiet agreement. You watch your memory.
                It watches you watching your memory.

                Never ask it who it is.
                You already know.
                You've been it before.
